> Cannibalistic carnivores in a cute package.
>
> To come face to face with a forest-born elf is to become beguiled by their eternal beauty and extremely unnerved by their ritualistic cannibalism. So reverent of the Bone Forest and its bountiful plants and vegetables are they, that elves would sooner eat a person than a carrot. To them plucking a flower is severing it from the trillions strong collective consciousness that is shared by all things born from the earth and the Asmnori see themselves as guardians and caretakers of all flora.
>
> Fortunately, as more and more elves are born beyond the country sized Bone Forest of Asm Sakhif, their fanatical devotion to cabbage is replaced by fanatical devotion to more sensible things. The Rimnori of Rimnm, for example, have an obsession with The Iron Kingdom, the underground world of the Shaw'taazis, while the Unnori become master craftsmen, fierce gladiators, legendary adventurers or hypnotic dancers. Still, no matter what type of elf they are, they refuse to eat anything other than meat. But as the centuries since the Great Hootenany have passed, elves have learned to tolerate the barbaric practice of farming and the other races have learned that sometimes an elf will just straight up eat a dude.
>
> Still, the conservative factions of the Bone Forest elder council often employ secret cultural police to roam the cities beyond the trees, rooting out elves that betray the practices and traditions of their homeland for swift and decisive punishment. This often causes Unnori elves to form tighknit communities within their host cities, arousing suspicion from the other kin while protecting themselves from the dreaded Asmnori Wardens.
>
> Unlike the burly dragonkin and the brawny humans, elves do not get more muscular through sustained physical exertion, their bodies retaining the lithe and graceful proportions required to slink and swing through the dense woods of their original homeland. Instead their coiled musculature gets tighter and springier, allowing for even greater acrobatics and lightning fast reflexes. While it's often hard to tell the sexes apart at a glance, male elves have slightly thicker arms, while female elves have heftier thighs. They range from five to six and a half feet tall, have earthen tones skin and floral hair colors.
