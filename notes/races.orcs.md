> The timeless, homeless, shameless greenfolk.
>
> For as long as there have been worlds to have them there have been orcs. The Dwarfs of the previous world claimed to have eradicated theirs but during the creation of Mundain and despite the best efforts of the gods, orcs made a massive comeback.
>
> Their stuted language skills, unshakeable single-mindedness and complete inability to learn from their previous mistakes have made the most wisened Dragonkin scholars question whether they are actually membes of the Awakened races or creatures of pure impulse, such as feral goblins or troglodytes.
>
> Lone orcs seem quite capable of living in civilized society, despite having no permanent settlements of their own, but when orcs get together they seem solely dedicated to one-upping each other, resulting in whirlwinds of orgiastic sex, unspeakable violence and incorrigible drinking. because of these impulses orc tribes have to stay at low populations for their own sake.
>
> Orcs often attach themselves to nomad or merchant caravans, providing protection against ambushes and a light-hearted atmosphere for long journeys. They make for excellent pirates, farmhands and bouncers, anything that surrounds them with heavy things to carry and people to enjoy.
>
> Orcs are between five and eight feet tall, their skin colors ranging from a vibrant yellow to a muted grey green Their musculature varies wildly, as does their tusk size. Orc males are no taller than females, nor any more muscular. Orcs largely choose their partners based on tusk compatibility, as for all their roughhousing and rowdiness, orcs love a good kiss. They're generally enjoyed by rural folk for their rambunctious, hard-partying attitude, but city dwellers often find them difficult to tolerate.
