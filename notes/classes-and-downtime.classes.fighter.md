## Becoming a Fighter

> They say you're too dumb to be a wizard, too clumsy to be a thief, too ugly to be a dancer or too fat-fingered to be a bard. But the truth is, they need you. They need you to throw the first punch, to step in the way of the dagger, to escalate every minor disagreement into life-altering violence.
>
> You're a pile of ugly muscle, a library of scar tissue and subcutaneous bleeding and an orchestra of cracking necks and punching knuckles. It takes more muscles to frown than to smile and that's the way you like it.
