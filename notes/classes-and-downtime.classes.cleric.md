## Becoming a Cleric

> You've been anointed by Gap'r, demigod of hedonism, to preach the universal constant. You're not some preachy paladin giving out science lessons and kicking ignorant heads off in equal measure, your role is to provide pleasure and rid the world of sources of pain and misery. And thanks to those tentacles that have started growing out of your back, that's never been easier.

After 3 sessions of Downtime in a brothel, each rolling a sex quality of Great or higher(**TODO: LINK THIS!**), the player can choose to become a Cleric and gain 1 tentacle. Each additional tentacle requires another 3 Downtime sessions of Great or higher sex in a brothel for a maximum of three tentacles.

Clerics lose 1 Hotness permanently and can only wear up to Medium Armour(**TODO: LINK THIS!**).

## Cleric Tentacles

A cleric's tentacles are incredibly dextrous, allowing their wielder to aid their allies and themselves in and out of combat.

Clerics gain up to 3 tentacles after 3 Downtime sessions each of Great Sex+(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) in a brothel. Each tentacle requires an Action(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) to use either a COmbat or Tactical Action(**TODO: LINK THIS!**), as decided by the Cleric, allowing all three tentacles to be used in a turn. Tentacles have various uses in and out of combat. After gaining their first tentacle, Clerics gain all of the abilities below, but additional tentacles allow Clerics to perform these abilities more or use multiple abilities in a given turn or situation. Finding creative uses for tentacles is greatly encouraged and potential idea should be discussed with your GM.

### In Combat

#### Tentacle Attack

The tentacle makes a basic attack with a melee weapon at a range of up to Distant(**TODO: LINK THIS!**). Tentacle Attacks using Tactical Actions(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) deal half damage rounding down. A weaponless tentacle deals d4+1 damage.

#### Intercept

If the Cleric has any Tactical Actions(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) at the end of their turn, they can choose to take the damage aimed at an ally during an enemy's turn. The tentacle has the same armour save as the Cleric. Shields held by tentacles do not require an additional Tactical Action to use when using Intercept.

#### Un-prone

If the Cleric has any Tactical Actions(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) at the end of their turn, they can use the tentacle to get an ally back in their feet without the ally spending a Tactical Action.

#### Steady & Stealthy

The Cleric can use a tentacle to add d6 to a Difficult Terrain(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) or Stealth(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) check to themselves or an ally.

#### Restrain

The Cleric can use a Tentacle to restrain a humanoid creature at a DC12 to escape. At the GMs discretion larger creatures may require more tentacles.

#### Calming Cuddle

The tentacle removes the Terrified, Berserk, Horny or Charmed status effect.(**TODO: LINK THIS!**)

### Out of Combat

#### Lurid Buff

The tentacle increases the Cleric's or an ally's Smarts, Brawn, Movie or Hotness by +2 for 1 combat encounter. A Lurid Buff can only be applied once per person per combat encounter and the effect only applies in combat.

#### Saved From Swallowed

The Tentacle adds +1 tp tje Cleric's or any ally's roll when rolling on the Swallowed(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) table.

#### Fiveplay

The Tentacle adds d6 to all Sex rolls for either the Cleric or any nearby ally.

#### Extra Partners

Each tentacle adds +1 to the Cleric's maximum sexual partner score.

#### Post-Tentacle Clarity

Once every 24 hours, a tentacle can attempt to remove a Vice(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) from an ally. Roll a d6 and add the Cleric's Hotness. On a 7 or higher, the Vice is lost.

Note that the Cleric cannot remove their own Vices this way.

#### Creepy Clambering

The tentacle adds d6 to the Cleric's or an ally's score when rolling for climbing, crossing difficult terrain, stealth or other movement-based DCs.
