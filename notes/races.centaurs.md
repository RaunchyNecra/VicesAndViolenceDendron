> Proof that the gods are rarely sober.

> Moments before the fourteenth dawn of creation, a drunken bet was made. Bored of humanity's reliance on the typical livestock and beasts of burden of previous worlds, the gods melded half og humanity to their precious domesticated animals, creating the centaur race, as well as a few more frightening races. It was assumed that without milk, wool and easy access to meat, eggs and transportation, that the races of Mundain would implode in a social cascade of entertaining violence. Instead it just mate them very strange.

> Most centaurs reside around the vast osases of Asm Sakhif, roaming the beaches of the enormous rivers that carve through the continent, acting as merchants of raw materials and sherpas for the two legged races. Many centaurs wander from their tribes as an escape from the tedium of leading idiots around the world, becoming adventurers and mercenaries to fuel their dreams of a cozy, sedentary lifestyle. This practice is so common that the furniture throughout the River Cities has adapted to the unusual geometry of centaurs, becoming wider, lo nger and more like beds and futons. Dragonkin scholars have attributed the population explosion of Asm Sakhif to all the comfortable beds in practically every room.
>
> Centaur martial arts primarily involve loading their backs with as many two legged sword swingers as possible and charging headlong into their enemies. This proves extremely effective, as most foes are too busy laughing to mount a decent defense.
>
> Despite centaurs having multiple styles of lower bodies, from horses to bulls and cows, goats and deer, they are collectively known as centaurs, as no one can remember all the unique terms for them.
>
> Centaurs stand between five and seven foot tall, with males generally being taller and broader than females.
