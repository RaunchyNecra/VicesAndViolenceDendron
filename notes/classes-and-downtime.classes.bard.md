## Becoming a Bard

> You're perfect. The crowd loves you. You ooze charisma, and the ballads of your adventures make taverns thump and brothels writhe. The jade earned by your performances can keep an entire party armoured, fed and fucked, and your prowess with charming verbosity can trick and seduce anyone that stands on your way.
>
> You're an ambassador. A sexual deviant. A soothing symphonist, and a god-damned warrior poet.
>
> Or at least you will be when you learn how to sing.

To be a bard, you'll need an instrument, a venue, and a performance. If your party is performing as a band or troupe, you'll need to add your performance rolls together and divide them by the number of members to find the average, rounding down. Bard performances require a session of Downtime for everyone performing.

## Bard Proficiency

Your Bard Proficiency starts at zero and is increased by one every time you complete a performance during Downtime. You can also increase your Bard Proficiency when traveling between cities by using Bard Practice(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) while Hunkering Down(**TODO: LINK THIS!**). Your Bard Proficiency also unlocks and buffss various abilities in and out of combat.

Having a [[Dancer|classes-and-downtime.classes.dancer]] perform with you increases your Bard Proficiency by an additional +1 with every performance, as well as earning additional jade. Dancers do not receive Bard Proficiency when Dancing. Dancers are encouraged but not required to sexually gratify the bard.

## Venue

The venue describes both the location quality of your performance, and the number of people watching. The venue acts as a multiplier for the effects described in your Performance roll, adding to the number of dice used in the effect. You can either roll on the Venue list, or choose to perform in a Dive Bar venue. The Venue multiplier is represented by a V in the Performance table.

### 1) Dive Bar

> A rundown old tavern, with rundown old patrons.

x1 multiplier

### 2) Hole in The Wall

> A tiny pub, but full to bursting with drunks.

x2 multiplier

### 3) Decent Inn

> A good sized inn, with plenty of ears to play for.

x3 multipliers

### 4) Packed Tent

> An outdoor venue filled with listeners and booze.

x4 multiplier

## Performance

Roll on the performance table and add your Bard Proficiency, then use the multiplier of your Venue to determine the effects of your performance. Natural 1s are always [[Calamitous|classes-and-downtime.classes.bard#1-2-calamitous]], no matter how many of your party are performing.

### 1-2) Calamitous.

> It wasn't even music. What the fuck was that? You were dragged off stage by te crowd and punched and kicked, fleeing the venue.

You each suffer d6xV damage, earn nothing and gain a Vice(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) each.

### 3-4) Well that was shit.

Not even a cough of embarrassment at the end of your performance. Eyes followed you out of the venue as you shuffle away in humiliation.

You earn nothing and gain a Vice(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) each.

### 5-6) Theydies and Gentlethem, uh... These guys.

> A smattering of polite applause, but the host of the event looks pissed.

## Bard Songs

Throughout the course of their career, Bards learn songs that can ensnare victims in dance, deafen them to sneaking allies, soothe allies wounds, charm the knickers off a fan and more.

As a bard's Proficiency increases, they learn new songs and their effectiveness increases with their Proficiency Modifier. Singing a Bard's song requires a Tactical Action(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) and their effects can be maintained indefinitely so long as the bard keeps spending a Tactical Action on their turn. Multiple Bards can sing the same song, even at a time, for a stacking or repeating effect.
