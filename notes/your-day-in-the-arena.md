Roll a d6 to determine if you actually learn your chosen [[Martial Skill|skills.martial-skills]] during your [[Downtime|classes-and-downtime]] spent in the Arena. It's easy to get distracted in the poorly lit undercrofts, surrounded by half naked specimens of peak physical fitness and soft touched healers. And a conk on the head doesn't bode well for remembering things.

## 1

You take a vicious blow to the head during the first seconds of the first match and are carried out of the fighting pit to the sounds of uproarious laughter and jeering.

You don't learn a skill and you gain a Vice(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) from the humiliation.

## 2

Instead of actually fighting you spend the day oiling, massaging and fucking the fighters.

You don't learn a skill but you have a very fun time.

## 3

You hold your own in the fighting pit and despite your defeat are able to learn a skill.

## 4

Your battle goes well and ends in a close, crowd-pleasing victory.

You learn a skill.

## 5

Your battle goes a little too well and you flaunt and entertain the crowd while waiting for another opponent. They also fall to your blade though the fight was more challengeing and you leave the arena beaming with pride.

You learn two skills.

## 6

Opponents fall left and right at your hand, replaces as quickly as they drop. Eventually you're dropped by an unseen blade but the crowd chants your name as you're dragged into the undercroft. Backstage fighters applaud your prowess and showmanship, clapping on your blood-drenched back, fondling your genitals and demanding you sign your names on to their skin and swords.

The manager of the arena showers you in d100xd6 jade and you learn two skills.
