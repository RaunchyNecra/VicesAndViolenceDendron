## Becoming a Wizard

> Any idiot can cast a couple spells, but becoming a full fledged wizard means turning into a poncho-donning, chain-smoking, book-bearing, hat-decorated, magic-staff wielding conduit of magical energy. Wizards have a solution to every problem, infinite tricks up fractally divided sleeves and unequivocally terrible eyesight. Let the meatheads do all the sword fighting and swashbuckling, you've got a reality to warp.
>
> Just remember, any wizard that doesn't have the body of a twenty one year old, a two foot cock and a harem of clone-wives is not the master of the arcane they claim to be.

Turns the target into a creature of your choice, including their stat block. If the target dies, it remains as the creature it was turned into, including the loot it drops.

Should the original target die, if they become a ghost instead of a zombie, they can inhabit the clone's body, retaining their spells, skills and abilities they had in life. Any Level Ups(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) ganed after the creation fo the clone are lost.

This is considered an extremely unethical spell.
