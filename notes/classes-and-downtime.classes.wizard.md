## Becoming a Wizard

> Any idiot can cast a couple spells, but becoming a full fledged wizard means turning into a poncho-donning, chain-smoking, book-bearing, hat-decorated, magic-staff wielding conduit of magical energy. Wizards have a solution to every problem, infinite tricks up fractally divided sleeves and unequivocally terrible eyesight. Let the meatheads do all the sword fighting and swashbuckling, you've got a reality to warp.
>
> Just remember, any wizard that doesn't have the body of a twenty one year old, a two foot cock and a harem of clone-wives is not the master of the arcane they claim to be.
