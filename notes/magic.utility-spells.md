Also known as Primordial Spells, Utility Spells cover all sorts of magic that fit into neither the Life(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) nor Death(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) categories, spells that have to be learned rather than being blessed with by bored Gods. Most of these spells are little more than parlour tricks, but many are useful in survival situations and occasionally handy in combat when use creatively.

Only those with innate magical ability can learn Utility Spells, but they'll need to be taught by a wizard or willing sorcerer, wo may not ask for simple jade in exchange for knowledge.

learning a Utility Spell takes twenty four hours and casting theses spells takes a Spell Use(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) like Life or Death magic.

It's recommended that a student uses their [[Downtime|classes-and-downtime]] to learn a Utility Spell and are able toi learn multiple spells at the same time, depending on the length of their Downtime.

Wizards and sorcerers are quite generous with the amount of time they'll give to pay them for lessons, unlike the Blood Cultists, bot the consequences for not paying them at all can be very dire indeed.
