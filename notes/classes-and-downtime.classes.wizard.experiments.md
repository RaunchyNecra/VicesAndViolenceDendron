> Wizards will happily teach new spells ot their young pupils, providing they act as a mannequin for research and experimentation.

In order to learn a spell, you must roll a d10 on the Experiments List below and accept the effects. Most of these Experiments are temporary and relatively harmless. If you really don't want to subject yourself to an experiment, ask your GM for a jade price or if a retainer can stand in for you.
