> It is said that the Gods created the goblins to give the unemployed something to do. In truth, the Gods lost all control of the goblins almost immediately. Unlike the other Awakened races, goblins are not born sentient, instead gaining self actualization through a cocktail of hallucinogenic cave mushrooms. These somewhat sensible goblinoids call themselves Gobbos, often attaching themselves to human nomad caravans to roam the world, stockpiling mushrooms for future generations.
>
> The solitary Gobbo city of Pyub is built around a gigantic tree that leaks hundreds of gallons of sap a day, which the Gobbos refine into a delicious, sweet alcohol that serves as their sole trade good throughout the world. It is theorized that the proliferation of Gobbo booze is a key factor in the impractical armour and casual nudity of the modern world. It's not, but people like a blame figure.

> Feral goblins are a common nuisance for travelers and pilgrims, raiding caravans for food, slaves and weaponry. Seasoned wanderers will purchase and carry supplies of powdered cave mushrooms to force enlightenment on raiding goblins. Due to this defense tactic, coupled with their dominant genetic makeup, sapient goblins are now one of the most prolific populations in Mundain. Those that breed with goblins birth goblins.

> Thanks to this, goblins range in height from two and a half to four and a half feet, with skin colors from vibrant green to dark yellow and ears that range from no longer than an elf's to as long as their body. Their sex organs vary wildly, from sensibly proportioned to torso encompassing. While this makes it very easy to differentiate them, male goblins have broader shoulders and thicker ears, while females are slightly shorter and have longer ears.

Gain +1 Moxie.
