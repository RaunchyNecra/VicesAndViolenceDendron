Magic staffs protect users from magical Fuck Ups(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) , absorbing the wild magic and channelling it into a successful cast. Staffs can only channel a set number of Fuck Ups before harmlessly exploding.

Staffs are measured by Fuck Ups in increments of five and costs 50j per increment. 50j for a +5 Staff, 100j for a +10 Staff and so forth.

When used as a melee weapon, Magic Staffs act as a Wood Staff(d4+1)(**TODO: LINK THIS!**).
