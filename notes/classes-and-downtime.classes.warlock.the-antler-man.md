> A cloaked figure with an endless hunger for fresh knowledge, arcane rituals and forgotten secrets, The Antler Man stalks the depths of Karkus. Carrying some alien fruit and wearing the skull of an imaginary animal, The Antler Man is clearly not of this world but his motives are relatively simple.
>
> Warlocks of The Antler Man grow gaunt and sleepy and their expanding intelligence makes them sardonic and nihilistic. Small horns grow randomly from their head and they quickly grow bored when away from a good book.

## Derisive Duellist
