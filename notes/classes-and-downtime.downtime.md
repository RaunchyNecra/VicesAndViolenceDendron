> An adventurer's life isn't one of constant peril, especially those that have yet to make a name for themselves. In the interim between quests, one can hone and improve their skills, in order to prepare for the next dangerous job.

In mechanical terms, Downtime allows players to come to their next gaming session with new spells and skills to try out, without slowing down their game by having to stop and learn new abilities in the middle of a session. Downtime can be resolved at the beginning or end of a session, or even away from the table, at the players and GM's convenience.

Learning a class requires a teacher, a skilled example of the profession. These can mainly be found in large towns and cities, so new adventurers are encouraged to not wander too far away from their home city while they're learning a class.

~~Each class has their own pages in this chapter, with their own abilities and requirements. Check each class page for further details.~~

## 1) Becoming a Bard

Being a ~~musician~~ [[Bard|classes-and-downtime.classes.bard]] requires instruments, a venue, a lot of practice. You'll slowly improve your musical abilities through performing at taverns, and eventually integrate your talents into your life as an adventurer.

## 2) Becoming a Wizard

Wizards have towers in town, where they can ply their trade for jade and practice. In order to pay to learn [[Utility Spells|magic.utility-spells]], you'll need to be able to be the subject of an experiment for your magical teacher. After learning enough spells, you'll have the opportunity to become a fully fledged [[Wizard|classes-and-downtime.classes.wizard]].

## 3) Learning Blood Magic

All magic is ostensibly [[Blood Magic|classes-and-downtime.classes.blood-magic]] , but the act o opening a vein can cut out the tedium of practicing the particular hand movements required required of proper spells. Blood magic is rudimentary and incredibly dangerous, but doesn't require Spell Uses (**TODO: LINK THIS!**) and can't backfire like Light (**TODO: LINK THIS!**) and Death (**TODO: LINK THIS!**) magic, so it's becoming increasingly popular with those outside wizardry circles.

## 4) Becoming a Paladin

Those that spend their time in the temples of Mundain are given the chance to become a [[Paladin|classes-and-downtime.classes.paladin]] of T'hot, a warrior-scholar that seeks out the dangerous and devious usage of magic to quash any magical mishaps. Through the adhering of Tenets, and adequitly equipping of blessed golden rings, a Paladin borrows T'hot's power to make the world a better place.

## 5) Becoming a Dancer

[[Elven Branch Dancing|classes-and-downtime.classes.dancer]] is a deadly form of evasive and exotic combat, using polearms as anchor to weave and and lash at enemies while dodging incoming attacks. The practice has benefits outside of combat too,m as branch dancers make for an enticing spectacle when paired with a bard troupe in a tavern.

## 6) Becoming a Fighter

City Arenas allow the common folk to slake their bloodlust, watching gladiators tear each other apart in combat, then be magically mended by on-site healers. [[Martial Skills|skills.martial-skills]] can be taught and learned through practical application here, though thee's always a chance of being beaten so badly, that a student has no time to absorb any knowledge.

## 7) Becoming a Thief

There's a [[Thieves Guild|classes-and-downtime.classes.thief]] in the bowels of every city, and for handsome and frequent donations, they'll be willing to part with a few tricks of the trade. With enough Treasuresgiven over, one can even earn their own Black Hood.

## 8) Becoming a Cleric

Very different from the Paladins of T'hot, [[Clerics|classes-and-downtime.classes.cleric]] are bestowed power bei Gap'r, growing retraceable tentacles from their back as a sign of their prowess in pleasure. These tentacles aid in combat, providing aid to allies and diverting attacks away from more vulnerable teammates.

## 9) Becoming a Warlock

A final act of desperation in the most dire of situations, adventurers can only become [[Warlocks|classes-and-downtime.classes.warlock]] when they're about to die. Warlocks receive power from a Patron, randomly selected, who morphs their Warlock's abilities and appearances to better suit their motives.
