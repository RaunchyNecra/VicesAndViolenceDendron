## Becoming a Warlock

> With your last breath, you called out for someone, anyone, to help. Unfortunately, the Fae answered and for the price of your life, the debt is immeasurable.

Players can choose to become a Warlock on the third turn of being Downed(**TODO: LINK THIS!**), just before they're about to die. Upon becoming a Warlock they revive with full Life, Spell Uses(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) and Exertion(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) and must roll for a Warlock Patron.

Remember: Becoming a Warlock can drastically alter your playstyle. Sometimes it's better to die.

## Warlock Patrons

Like all Fae, they are creatures made manifest through a combination of their own giant ego and concentrations of latent primordial magic. They are not of this world, in fact they seem reborn from the thirteen previous worlds.

Every Patron offers a **Boon** and a **Bane** that comes into effect when levelling Up(**TODO: LINK THIS!**). These slowly warp the Warlock into their Patron's ideal form but can alter their role in their party.

In addition to Boons and Banes, Warlocks suffer a cumulative **-1 Disposition** every time they level up as they slowly become more strange and warped. Patrons also bestow their abilities to their Warlock as they level up.

### 1) [[The Antler Man|classes-and-downtime.classes.warlock.the-antler-man]]

## Seeking Specific Patrons

While Warlock Patrons appear at random to the dying and desperate, their corporeal forms do exist throughout Mundain and some adventurers travel to beseech a specific Patron's aid, aware of the cost of their bestowed power.

Traveling to the domain of a Patron to willingly become a Warlock is a campaign defining experience and should be discussed among the aspiring Warlock's party. The right adventurer with the right Patron can become incredibly powerful, so GMs should prepare accordingly.
