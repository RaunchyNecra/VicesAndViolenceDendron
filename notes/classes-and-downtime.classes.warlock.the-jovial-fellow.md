> You can hear his uproarious guffawning from across Seedswallow Swamp, the ethereal laughter of The Jovial Fellow. His motives seem simple, to eat, drink and be merry, and his Warlocks reflect that, slowly turning green, fat and black-eyed and meeting death and danger with a hearty laugh.

> Warlocks of The Jovial Fellow are exceptionally tough but increasingly lazy and would much rather be leading a drunken chorus at a local tavern then out adventuring. They're a cheerful lot, eben in the most dire of circumstances, but their green skin and black eyes make people wary all the same.
