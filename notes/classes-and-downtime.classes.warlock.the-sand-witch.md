> One of the few Fae to inhabit the Red Desert, The Sand Witch endlessly gallops across the cracked wastes, seemingly with the only motive of beating their previous record from end to end. While most Fae find homes among enchanted forests and mythical swamps, The Sand Witch remembers a dying world of endless sand and disparate slave cities where one's ability to survive a journey was determined by their stamina.
