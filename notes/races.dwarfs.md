> The stocky conquerors of the previous world.
>
> When the gods get bored and drop a fresh world on top of the old one, they usually assume that the apocalyptic bombardment of half-formed islands, mountains and oceans is enough to kill off any straggling occupants of the world before. Unfortunately, the Dwarfs of The Iron Kingdom had already made the underground their home for thousands of years and their incredible feats of forging and architecture allowed them to survive an entire world being dumped on top of them. When they finally emerged into the fourteenth world with stories of worlds under theirs that were destroyed by the gods, their arrival triggered a global uprising and the inadvertent usurpation of the gods.
>
> Known in their native tongue as The Shaw'taazis, commonly pronounced as Short Arses, the Dwarfs have made contact with several surface world societies in recent millennia, trading iron and bizarre technology for food, cloth, spices and furs.
>
> Dwarfs have lost the pigment in their skin and hair from millennia underground. Their hair grows incredibly quickly, several inches a day, resulting in traditional dwarfs using their beards as dust filtration systems when mining. Biologically female dwarf beards range from mutton chops that are lost in the rest of their hair to full beards depending on their clan genetics.
>
> In recent centuries, Dwarven society is suffering an ideological split. Certain dwarf factions retain their traditionalist, isolationist mantra, shunning the world above to keep to themselves and their ancient values, while more idealistic dwarfs head to the surface with an open mind and a yearning for adventure. Most topside dwarfs are using magic to slow down the growth of their beards or remove them entirely, partially for comfort in the humid warmth of Mundain, largely to enjoy the newfound pleasures available.

> Dwarfs are between three and five feet tall, with males slightly taller than females. Their eyes are always red and their hair and skin is always very pale, making them somewhat hard to tell apart to untrained eyes. They're generally wary of other racers but are most of Satyrs and Goblins for being og a similar, sensible height.
