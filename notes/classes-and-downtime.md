This chapter details the various classes one can build their character towards using Downtime, the period of life that happens between game sessions, when players are away from their tale. Think of Downtime as the period when characters are "away from the camera", and are going about their lives and practicing their skills in the relative safety of the city.

> Starting at the bottom, a prospective adventurer has to dedicate time and practice to learn the skills and spells required to survive. To do this, they use their Downtime, those calm days between questing and dungeon crawling to improve their abilities. In time, and with the dedication, a bumbling wannabe can become a fearsome adversary on the battlefield.
