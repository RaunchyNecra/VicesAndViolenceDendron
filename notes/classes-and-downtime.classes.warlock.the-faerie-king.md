> Unlike his cryptic colleagues the Faerie King does not speak in rhymes and riddles. Instead he tells stories of his world, a world of chivalric knights and noble lords, rolling plains and magical forests, all of which he corrupted and destroyed for the fun of it. Now, deep inside Seedswallow Swamp, he has returned to corrupt the world anew.
>
> Warlocks of The Faerie King act like these Arthurian Legends, behaving with a sense of chivalry, honour and loyalty to their king in a world where these concepts never existed. All the while being morphed into beautiful, gullible,pastel-haired and pink-eyed idiots.

Warlocks of The Faerie King gain +1 Hotness but lose 1 Smarts every time they Level Up(**TODO: LINK THIS!**). Every 2 rimes a Faerie King Warlock levels up they gain one of the following abilities.
