> A bizarre creature with a wicked grin, The mad Stray flutters around Seedswallow Swamp at night, posing riddles and playing games with hapless wanderers. His arms are riddled with astral charts of a similar sky, but his mannerisms and puzzles allude to a world too unusual to describe or decipher and his Warlocks reflect this.

> Warlocks of The Mad Stray gain the same glowing green eyes and astral charts along their arms, slowly losing their minds and bodies to their patron's mad whims. Thy tend to smile a broad, toothy grin, often when all seems lost.

Warlocks of The Mad Stray gain +4 Spell Uses(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) but lose 1 on an ability every time they Level Up(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) determined by a d4 roll.

1. Smarts
2. Brawn
3. Moxie
4. Hotness

Every 2 times a Mad Stray Warlock levels up they gain one of the following abilities.

## Glowing Green Eyes

- Two Level Ups

The Warlock gains glowing green eyes that act as a light source similar to a lantern or torch. When the Warlock's eyes are open this negatively affects any Stealth(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) rolls for the party, similarly to other light sources.

## Cheating a Cheating Fate

- Four Level Ups

The Warlock leans the [[Cheat Fate|magic.utility-spells#19-cheat-fate]] Utility Spell. Instead of being used once per day, Cheat Fate costs 10 Spell Uses(**TODO: LINK THIS!**). Cheat Face can be used on any DC roll, even those rolled by other adventurers.

## Distorted Destiny

- Six Level Ups

The Warlock can use a Spell Use(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) to add +2 to any result of a Dice Challenge roll that they perform, for as many Spell Uses as they have.
