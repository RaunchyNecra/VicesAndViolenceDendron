> The reptilian founders of the Ricer Cities

> A catch-all term for the various sub-races of lizardfolk, the Dragonkin are the inventors of the modern alphabet, bronze smelting and the architectural techniques required to build the great ziggurats and city states found throughout Asm Sakhif. Varying so greatly in size, shape and color, the few things that unite the races are their scaly skin, their exotic hermipenes and their expansive brain capacity.
>
> However, due to their cold blood and inefficient, tightly coiled brains, Dragonkin must lounge lazily for days at a time to unlock their impressive intellects, pumping blood away from their muscles into their brain tendrils. This means that Dragonkin must choose to be smart or strong by being sedentary or active respectively and as society has evlolved, the ability to be lazy has grown ever more expensive.
>
> The bizarre physiology of the Dragonkin extend to their breeding process. The males of the species carry a pair of egg laying ovipositors, which deposits eggs into the female's fertilization chamber, after which the female's breast-like sacks deliver sperm-like fluid and a hardening agent to the newly fertilized eggs. THis means that the sexes of the Dragonkin are actually reserved but no one has bothered to correct this mistake.
