> Formerly important, now importantly formal.
>
> Humans were once the most prolific race of Mundain, their vat empires spanning the globe, peppering the land with great sone fortresses and honeycombing the earth with endless mausoleums, dungeons and twisting labyrinths in millennia-long wars for territory and resources, influenced by whispering gods and tyrant kings. Only when the Dwarfs emerged from the world below and told of the capricious nature of the gods did the humans rise up against their masters in a cataclysmic magical battle turned world-wide orgy known as The Great Hootenany. millions died at the hands of wild, unchecked, primordial magic and the six fingered sorcerers that learned to wield it. The survivors fled south to warmer climates, creating the nomadic culture found in humans today.
>
> In the modern era, humans have adopted a tightknit, heavily structured matrilineal clan system, revering firstborn daughters as the maintainers of their bloodline and trading sons among the clans to add to the firstborn's harem or as additional labour and security if rejected. Second-born daughters can refuse a lesser harem and a life of perpetual pregnancy and are often sent to work, to earn jade out on their own for the roving families, while unclaimed sons must make their own way in the world. This regimented lifestyle is often the cause for many humans abandoning their clan to live in the remaining urban centers of Mundain or carve out a life of adventure with other kin. Human settlements are known as Duns, communal towns ringed by psychedelic fungi as a defense against feral goblin hordes.
>
> Humans have a natural affinity for magic and make up the vast majority of wizards and sorcerers across the world. They are generally amicable to the other kin, especially Orcs and Goblins, that have adopted elements of human culture, and are often integrated into clan families. Unfortunately their roaming nature means they have no proper way to dispose of their dead and so those dungeons and labyrinths once created during the Imperial Age are now filled with societies of self-aware human zombies.
>
> Humans average between four and a half to seven and a half feet tall, have earth and sand toned skin and live to about a century. Females are often taller than males due to their value in clan hierarchy, this receiving more food at a young age.
