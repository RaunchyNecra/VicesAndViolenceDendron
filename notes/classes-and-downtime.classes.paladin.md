## Becoming a Paladin

> You were born with a terrible curse, an unshakeable sense of right an wrong. And like everyone with an unerring moral compass, you combine the unending cynicism of a healer with the explosive temper of a fighter. Now, clad in the black and gold robes of the twin demi-goddesses and blessed gold rings of T'hot, it's time to ruin everyone's day.
>
> Paladins are part paramedic, part substitute teacher, part wandering lawman, with all the grim sardonicism those professions entail. There's only one rule when a Paladin is around: Fucking. Behave.

Paladins gain power by accepting Vows, a solemn promise to uphold a certain aspect of T'hot's teaching of morality and goodness. Each vow comes with a golden ring imbued with a small portion of T'hot's power and attuned it to the soul of the vow taker. Paladins can take as many Vows as they with but cannot revoke an individual Vow without revoking all of them. Think carefully when taking Vows, as each restricts a prospective Paladin's options when adventuring. The more Vows a Paladin takes, the more benefits the temple bestows upon them.

Paladins are required to know the Heal(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) and Goup Heal(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) spells, which adventurers can lean by attending Magical Lectures(**TODO: LINK THIS!**).
