Blood magic requires the caster to sacrifice Life to cast spells. Roll any dice of your choosing to determine the amount of Life Lost and the power of the Spell.

Blood magic takes from your Spell Uses(**TODO: LINK THIS!**), but does not require a Casting(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) roll.

As payment the cult demands:

1. That you break a cultist out of the local gaol.
2. d6x2 Bone Swords(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) and the same in Armour(**TODO: LINK THIS!**).
3. The head of the Captain of the town Guard.
4. Tat you convert d6 people to the cult.
5. That the town gates are left open tonight.
6. The treasured pendant of a noble woman.
7. that the local guard barracks burns down tonight.
8. That you pleasure the cult's Tentacloid mascot.
9. d6 portions of Goblin Awakening mushrooms(**TODO: LINK THIS!**).
10. Your left arm, from the elbow.
11. The death of the town smithy. Make it look like an accident.
12. Sex with the cult leader of Great quality or better.
