> She is terrifying. Prowling the sodden, burnt forests of The Taint, The Cowled Lady is a mangled husk, riddled with scar tissue from innumerable cuts, burns and bites. Warriors see themselves in her broken visage, wat unquenchable rage and unbridled violence does to a person. And the truly desperate will beseech her aid anyway.

> Warlocks of The Cowled Lady become frighteningly strong but increasingly covered in ugly, misshapen battle scars. They are sullen and depressing to interact with but come alive in battle, whirling through enemies with petrifying ferocity.

Warlocks of the Cowled Lady gain +1 Brawn but lose 1 Hotness every time they Level Up. Every 2 times a Cowled Lady Warlock levels up they gain one of the following abilities.

## Kill

- Two Level Ups

If the Warlock downs an enemy, they can choose to immediately kill them without needing to use a Combat Action(**TODO: LINK THIS!**).

## Kill Them

- Four Level Ups

The Warlock becomes immune to the Berserk(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) status effect. Instead the Warlock can choose to become Berserk at any time during combat and remove the Berserk status effect at any time.

## Kill Them All

- Six Level Ups

If the Warlock downs an enemy they regain their Combat Action(**TODO: LINK THIS!**), which they can use immediately.
