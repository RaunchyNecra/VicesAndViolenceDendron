> The ancient practice of Elven branch-dancing has evolved over time into a deadly and seductive martial art. Using staffs, spears and halberds in combination with vicious dagger.heel shoes. Dancers stake their weapons into the ground and provocatively twirl around them, creating a flurry of near-naked blades and blood.
>
> Dancers refuse to use magic as their art is one of flesh and flexibility and require Skimpy armour to bend and twirl about their weapons.
