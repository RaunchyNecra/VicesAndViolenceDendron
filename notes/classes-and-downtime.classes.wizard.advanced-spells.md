Created an exact physical copy of the target, though without any of the spells or abilities the target has. The clone has the personality of the original, but none of the memories. Should the original target die, if they become a ghost instead of a zombie, they can inhabit the clone's body, retaining their spells, skills and abilities they had in life. Any Level Ups(**TODO: LINK THIS!**) gained after the creation fo the clone are lost.

This is considered an extremely unethical spell.
